## Assignment of CRUD API for provinces and cities of Indonesia

![poweredBy](dev.png)

In this project, we are learning and creating a project about **CRUD** (create, read, update and delete) process.
Also we are going to make API end point that is related to the CRUD process.

## Important Note (to our dear mentor Arya Kusuma)
You can find 2 files: app.js and app-tugas.js. The one that is required to assignment submission is **app-tugas.js** üëç.
While app.js is the one we are using to explore the features of SequelizeJS

## Revision / Version
As we are making progress in learning things, the project is also growing into more complex features.
Below is some note, regarding the project revision / version.

| Rev./Ver. | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1.0 | make **Create** and **Read API** for provinces and cities |
| 1.1 | add **Update** and **Delete API** for provinces and cities |
| 1.2 | add API for **province's detail** (includes all the cities that **belongs to the province**) |
| 1.3 | add validation process that check whether the city / province to be inserted, are existed or not |

## Entity Relational Diagram 
Below is the diagram of the table that we need to create:

## Associations
We are also trying to explore about associations between tables. As depicted in the ERD above, we have a one to many relations between province and city table.
One province can have many cities, but one city belong to one province.

This is done in models' files with these syntaxes:
```
Provinces.hasMany(models.Cities);
Cities.belongsTo(models.Provinces);
```

## API Endpoints
Here are the list of API endpoint:

| API | Objective |
| --- | --- |
| `app.get(/province)` | get all provinces' name |
| `app.get(/province/:id)` | get a province's detail by its ID |
| `app.post(/province)` | create/add one or more province(s) |
| `app.put(/province/:id)` | update a province's detail |
| `app.delete(province/:id)` | delete a province |
| `app.get(/province/:id/city)` | get all the cities that belongs to a specific province |
| `app.get(/city)` | get all cities' name |
| `app.get(/city/:id)` | get a city's detail by its ID |
| `app.post(/city)` | create/add one or more city(s) |
| `app.put(/city/:id)` | update a city's detail |
| `app.delete(city/:id)` | delete a city |

## API Simulation
We are using Postman to simulate the API end point. You can find the Postman JSON file in this repository, called:
`fwd10_prov_city.postman_collection.json`

## Validation
In this project the validation process is perfomed to check whether the city / province to be inserted, are already existed or not. From [documentation](https://sequelize.org/docs/v7/core-concepts/validations-and-constraints/), there is: **Validations & Constraints**. Validations are checks performed in the Sequelize level, the code that we put in our JavaScript file. On the other hand, constraints are rules defined at SQL level. 

Example of constraint in our project for provinceName: 
```
/* ... */ {
  provinceName: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true
  },
  } /* ... */
```
This makes **provinceName** unique and no other objects can have same value. However, we have not tried this constraint in **Version 1.3**. Instead we are using validation, which in a nutshell works by comparing the (new) input **provinceName** with existing data in MySQL database.
```
Provinces.findOne({ where: { provinceName: req.body.provinceName } })
```
So basically we make a query, to find a row/data whose provinceName value equals provinceName from the input request body.
